Key Components:

HTML: Forms the structure and content of your web pages. You'll use it to create elements like headings, paragraphs, images, forms, and links.
CSS: Styles the visual presentation of your website. This includes colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and responsiveness across different devices.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. Use it for features like image sliders, product carousels, form validation, and AJAX for smooth page updates.
PHP: Handles the server-side logic. It processes user input, interacts with the database, manages user sessions, and handles tasks like adding products to the cart and processing orders.
Database (MySQL): Stores all the website's data, including product information, user accounts, order history, and more.
Development Steps:

Design: Plan the website's layout, user interface, and features.
Frontend: Build the HTML structure, style it with CSS, and add interactivity with JavaScript.
Backend: Set up the database, write PHP code to handle server-side logic, and connect it to the frontend.
Testing: Thoroughly test the website on different browsers and devices.
Deployment: Upload the files to a web server to make the website live.
